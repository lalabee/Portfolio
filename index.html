        I have done most of the stereotypical things that grandmas do, without having grandchildren. I am now finished with all of that. I am learning to code. It is very exciting to learn so many new things. I told my daughter, who is an Epicodus alumnus, that I am already a "Senior Developer," I am a developer and I am over 65!
